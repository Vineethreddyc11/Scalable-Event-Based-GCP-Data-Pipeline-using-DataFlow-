# Scalable-Event-Based-GCP-Data-Pipeline-using-DataFlow-

## Business Overview
Perishable data is information whose value can significantly decline over a period of
time. When the operating conditions change to the point that the knowledge is no longer
helpful, the information loses a large amount of its value. This information is frequently
produced in an IoT computing context. Managing perishable data provides a number of
benefits. Real-time data provides you with the information you need almost instantly and
in the context which helps make smarter business decisions. The use of data from edge
computing devices speeds up reaction time and minimizes time to action. Such data
does not need to be kept in data centers for a long time and maybe deleted after usage,
saving storage space and money. Systems are usually designed on constant patterns
and can’t scale with peaks in the load resulting in latency and server failures.
This Project will simulate real-time accidents data and architect a pipeline that will help
us analyze and take quick actions using AWS Kinesis, Apache Flink, Grafana, and
Amazon SNS.
